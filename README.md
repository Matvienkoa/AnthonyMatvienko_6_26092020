# Piquante

This is the back end server for the Project 6 of the Junior Developer path of Openclassrooms.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and npm installed locally on your machine.

## Installation

Clone this repo. 

From within the project folder, create an .env file and enter the following lines :

LOGIN=Mentor  
PASSWORD=OCRoomsP6  
URL=cluster0.5rox4.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority  

Then run npm install. 

You can then run the server with node server. The server should run on localhost with default port 3000. If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. Listening on port 3001.
